# ObjectSerializable
The application of this interface enables the implementation of a Java serialization mechanism that automates the process of storing objects and arrays. Not every object can be written to the output stream. Objects that can be written are called serialized objects. A serialized object is an instance of the java.io.Serializable interface so the object class must apply the Serilizable class. The Serializable interface is a marker interface. As it has no methods, you do not have to add additional code to your class that implements the Serializable interface.
